XML VS JSON



JSON - is lightweight
-> supports lot of data types 
->package.json 
-> JSON saves bandwidth



XHR
- object used to interact with servers

- readyState - 
 0 -uninit
1-loading (connection is open)
2-loaded(request has been sent)
3-response partially arrived
4-completed (data has comletely arrived and connection has been closed)

XHR doesnt maintain session history implicity 
we have to explicitly store history of sesh

 
WITH JSON sent or recieved from server we dont need header as it works seemlessly with js
