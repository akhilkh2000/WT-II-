    //submission throttling
    //to reduce the number of requests that are sent to server and to reduce the number of requests handled by the browser
    //balance : responsiveness and resource utilization
    //data buffers(used by google suggest) - on client side to store data before sending 
    //another way is using a command queue
    //decision factors :
    /*
        1. timeout period - once this is reached send buffer stuff to server(also can keep collecting until user is idle)
        2. length of buffer - once a threshold length is reached send to server
        3. user idle time

        *how many buffers can we have ?
            example : blog 
                3  buffers : 1. Low priority - (comments eg every 15 seconds)
                             2. medium priority (every 3 secs - latest feed )
                             3. High priority (every 0.2 seconds) Test buffer that gives you rest of your blog as you scroll

        * how long should the throttle period be
          -
