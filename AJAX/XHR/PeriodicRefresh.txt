- Basically how does server inform user changes occurring on server
- peridodic refresh - (auto update, polling , real-time, synchronize)
-we need to keep the clients info in sync with the info on the server
- ideally we would need 0 delay and latency time between server info and client info 

-- objective must be to increase avg refresh period an
-- Fallback patterns - when a server is down or is going thorugh issues
   --  suppose we are still sending periodic requests every second , that may lead to server crash or latency errors so we need to :
            - cancel pending requests 
            - try again  based on timeout property (wait for the server for specified time)
            - exponential backoff based on successful response 

-- How long will refresh period will be ?
    - three categories of activity level
        1. Real time interaction (milliseconds) 
            (info is time critical - Flights , scores)
        2. Active monitoring (seconds)
            (security desk of CCTV footage , every second refresh is fine as humans)
        3. Casual monitoring(minutes)
            (news sites etc , blogs )
        4. Manual refresh based on refresh button
